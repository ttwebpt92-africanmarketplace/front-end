# Front-End

Use "npm install" from your terminal within the 'African-Marketplace' folder. Then "npm start" to pull up a local server to view any changes. Routing is handled in App.js. Private routes were used to manage the dashboard and components available only to logged-in users. The private routing was defined in src/Components/PrivateRoute.js such that a user requires a token, received on login, for access.
